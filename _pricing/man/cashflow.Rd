}
\arguments{
\item{age}{Initial age of policyholder in years}

\item{gender}{Gender of policyholder, \code{gender = "F"} (female), \code{"M"} (male)}

\item{policy}{Policy type to simulate:
\code{policy = "AP"} (Account Based Pension),
\code{"RM"} (Reverse Mortgage),
\code{"LA"} (Life Annuity),
\code{"CA"} (Care Annuity),
\code{"PA"} (Pooled Annuity),
\code{"VA"} (Variable Annuity)}

\item{paths}{Number of paths to simulate (Monte-Carlo method)}
}
\value{
Matrix of cash flow vectors for each simulated path
}
\description{
Simulate cash flows using Monte-Carlo methods for various policies
