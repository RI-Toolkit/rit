  female = 1,
  death_probs = NULL,
  closure_age = 130,
  cohort = 1000,

}
\arguments{
\item{init_age}{the initial age of individuals}

\item{female}{numeric denoting the gender of individuals, 1 for female and 0 for male}

\item{death_probs}{a vector of 1-year death probabilities. If not supplied, an M7 age-period-cohort
model will be fitted on \code{mortality_AUS_data} to produce forecasted
death probabilities for a cohort starting at init_age in 2022}

\item{closure_age}{maximum life span}

\item{cohort}{initial cohort size}

\item{n_sim}{number of path simulations}

\item{seed}{integer to be used as the seed for simulation}
}
\value{
a matrix where each row represents the number of individuals still alive
from a given cohort at each age
}
