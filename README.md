# Retirement Income Toolkit - Health State Modelling (main branch)

This module will produce transition probabilities for health state and functional disability models for a specified initial age (from 50 to 65 up to age 110) and health state based on the calibrated parametrization of models. Models will include functional disability based on various ADLâ€™s (2+, 3+, cognitive decline) with recovery, joint health status and functional disability, as well as disability states based on core activities for Australian applications. Models to include static models, improvement trends in transition rates and stochastic transition rates (latent factor). For stochastic rates, model output to have expected transition rates and simulated future transition rates for stochastic simulations. Output will include probability transition matrices for different starting ages derived from transition rates, with trends. Models will be included to forecast the Australian prevalence of disabled populations based on functional disability models.
