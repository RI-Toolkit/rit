# Retirement Income Toolkit - Aggregate Mortality Simulation (head branch)
This module will produce future cohort mortality scenarios for a specified age group for input into cash flow simulation and valuation modules. Input will be the model selected and parameter estimates derived from other available R packages (StMoMo). A range of aggregate mortality models (including Lee-Carter, Age-Period-Cohort, Renshaw-Haberman, CBD, Gaussian affine 2 and 3-factor models) will be included so users can select the preferred model. Output will be a specified number of simulated vectors of future cohort mortality rates and survival probability curves at future dates for a specified age cohort (starting from age 50 to age 110). Output includes initial age risk-adjusted survival probabilities using specified risk adjustment methods (with input parameters for risk adjustment) â€“ Sharpe ratio, Wang transform, price of risk for factor models); distributions of future lifetimes along with summary statistics including expected future lifetime, standard deviation of future lifetime, impact of uncertainty in mortality rates versus expected mortality rates and survival probabilities.
