This module takes input aggregate mortality scenarios, functional disability/health status scenarios, economic scenarios to simulate cash flows on retirement products, including account-based pensions, life annuities, deferred life annuities, pooled annuities, long-term care insurance, care annuities, variable annuities with GMWB, reverse mortgages with NNEG. Expected cash flows are computed. Options features in cash flows dependent on equity returns, interest rate, mortality, health, house prices are priced. Risk-adjusted expected cash flows are computed, and prices are determined based on specified assumptions. Models use Australian data for Australian applications initially. The module includes government age pension and aged care based on current means-testing.
